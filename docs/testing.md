## Running Tests

Inside the DevContainer:

```bash
# Full test suite
bundle exec rspec

# By category
bundle exec rspec spec/models/
bundle exec rspec spec/services/
bundle exec rspec spec/requests/

# Single file or line
bundle exec rspec spec/models/user_spec.rb
bundle exec rspec spec/models/user_spec.rb:30
```

## Test Design Decisions

### Multi-tenancy (acts_as_tenant)

`rails_helper.rb` includes an `around` hook that wraps examples in `ActsAsTenant.with_tenant` when the `:tenant` metadata is provided. For request specs, the tenant is resolved via subdomain (`host!`), matching the production behavior.

### OPA Authorization

All external HTTP calls to OPA are stubbed with WebMock. Two helpers are available in `spec/support/opa_helper.rb`:

| Helper           | Behavior                          |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `stub_opa_allow` | OPA returns `{ "result": true }`  |
| `stub_opa_deny`  | OPA returns `{ "result": false }` |

The OpaClient service spec also covers the **fail-closed** case — when OPA is unreachable, access is denied.

### PostgreSQL RLS

In the test environment, the `SET ROLE` / `RESET ROLE` commands used for RLS are stubbed in request specs. This is because the `rails_user` role may not exist in the test database. Tenant isolation is still tested through `acts_as_tenant` scoping.

### Authentication (Devise)

Request specs use `Devise::Test::IntegrationHelpers` (included for `type: :request`) to call `sign_in` directly, bypassing the Auth0 OAuth flow.
